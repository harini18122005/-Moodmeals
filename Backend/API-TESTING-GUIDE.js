// Instructions for Testing with Real Spoonacular API Key

/* 
IMPORTANT: How to test with real API data

1. GET A VALID API KEY:
   - Go to https://spoonacular.com/food-api
   - Sign up for an account
   - Get your API key from the dashboard

2. UPDATE YOUR .env FILE:
   Replace the current API key with your new one:
   SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here

3. RESTART THE SERVER:
   npm start

4. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH REAL API:
   ✅ Real recipe images (high-quality photos)
   ✅ Detailed step-by-step instructions
   ✅ Complete ingredient lists with measurements
   ✅ Nutrition information
   ✅ Source URLs to original recipes
   ✅ Real cooking times and serving sizes

5. CURRENT FALLBACK SYSTEM (when API quota exceeded or invalid key):
   ✅ Beautiful emoji images (🍪, 🌈, 🍨, etc.)
   ✅ Comprehensive recipe details and instructions  
   ✅ All functionality working perfectly
   ✅ Professional UI with modal popups
   ✅ 3x3 responsive grid layout

6. THE SYSTEM IS SMART:
   - Automatically detects API status
   - Shows real data when API works
   - Gracefully falls back to demo data when needed
   - Users get a great experience either way!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you see "API quota reached" - your daily limit is exceeded
- If you see "not authorized" - your API key is invalid
- If you see emoji images - the fallback system is working correctly
- If you see real photos - your API integration is working!
