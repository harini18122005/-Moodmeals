# Production Environment Variables for Frontend

# For local development (keep as is):
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# For production deployment (update after backend deployment):
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api

# Note: This file should be named .env and placed in your frontend root directory
# The frontend API service will automatically use the production URL when deployed
