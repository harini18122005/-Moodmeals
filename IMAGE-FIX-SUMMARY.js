/* PROBLEM SOLVED! ✅
   
   ISSUE: Recipe images were not displaying properly in the frontend

   Backend Changes (foodController.js):
   - All recipes now use emoji images instead of placeholder URLs
   - Proper UTF-8 Content-Type headers added for emoji support

   Frontend Changes (SuggestionPage.js):
   - Added RECIPE_EMOJIS mapping object for reliable emoji display
   - Enhanced image rendering logic with proper fallbacks
   - Debug logging added to track image loading issues
   - Uses recipe.id to map to correct emoji from RECIPE_EMOJIS object
